# Credit-Risk-Analysis
We have performed data analysis and data visualisation on a subset of the Lending Club dataset and then created a logical regression model to  assess whether or not a new customer is likely to meet it's debt obligations(pay back the loan).
## Introduction
Credit analysis is a type of analysis an investor or bond portfolio manager performs on companies or other debt issuing entities to measure the entity's ability to meet its debt obligations. The credit analysis seeks to identify the appropriate level of default risk associated with investing in that particular entity.
